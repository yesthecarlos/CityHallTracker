- C#
- .NET 5
- MySQL

**If you finish developing the [minimum viable product (MVP)](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/the-minimum-viable-product) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.**

- Use keywords in actions to search local newspaper website and display top results next to actions to give user context
- Allow users to login and favorite/save actions that were important to them
